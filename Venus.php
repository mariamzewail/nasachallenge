Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. However, Venus has a thick atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, creating an intense greenhouse effect that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the solar system with surface temperatures around 465°C, hot enough to melt lead.

Venus has a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers, and its atmosphere is filled with thick clouds of sulfuric acid, which reflect sunlight and give Venus its bright appearance in the sky. It rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets, meaning a day on Venus (243 Earth days) is longer than a Venusian year (225 Earth days).

Despite its harsh environment, Venus once might have had liquid water, but today its surface is dry, rocky, and marked by volcanoes and vast plains. Venus has been a key focus for scientists studying climate change due to its runaway greenhouse effect.                                            diameter of about 12,742 km and a mass of approximately 5.97 × 10^24 kg. Earth orbits the Sun 
                                            at an average distance of 149.6 million km, completing one revolution in 365.26 days. It has one 
                                            natural satellite, the Moon, and a diverse atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen.
