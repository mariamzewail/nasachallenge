Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is unique for its blue-green color, which is caused by the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers, making it the third-largest planet in the solar system. Uranus is classified as an ice giant, consisting mainly of hydrogen, helium, and ices such as water, ammonia, and methane.

One of the most distinctive features of Uranus is its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, which means it rotates on its side compared to its orbit. This unusual tilt results in extreme seasonal changes, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.

Uranus has a faint ring system composed of several thin, dark rings made up of ice and rock particles. The planet has at least 27 known moons, with the five largest being Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Each of these moons has unique geological features, with Miranda displaying a diverse landscape of canyons and ice cliffs.

Uranus orbits the Sun every 84 Earth years, and its atmosphere features dynamic weather patterns, including high-speed winds. The study of Uranus helps astronomers understand the characteristics and formation of ice giants in our solar system.                                            diameter of about 12,742 km and a mass of approximately 5.97 Ã— 10^24 kg. Earth orbits the Sun 
                                            at an average distance of 149.6 million km, completing one revolution in 365.26 days. It has one 
                                            natural satellite, the Moon, and a diverse atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen.
