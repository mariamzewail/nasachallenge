Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 142,984 kilometers, making it more than 11 times wider than Earth. As a gas giant, it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid surface. One of Jupiter's most famous features is the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm that has been raging for over 300 years and is large enough to fit two Earths within it.

Jupiter has a very short rotation period, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours, but it takes about 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun. The planet is surrounded by at least 79 known moons, with the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—referred to as the Galilean moons. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even exceeding the size of Mercury.

Jupiter has a powerful magnetic field, the strongest of any planet, which creates intense radiation belts around it. Its atmosphere features colorful bands of clouds, composed of ammonia and water, which swirl in high-speed winds. Studying Jupiter helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of gas giants and the dynamics of planetary atmospheres.                                            diameter of about 12,742 km and a mass of approximately 5.97 × 10^24 kg. Earth orbits the Sun 
                                            at an average distance of 149.6 million km, completing one revolution in 365.26 days. It has one 
                                            natural satellite, the Moon, and a diverse atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen.
